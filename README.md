# MD-Practical
Practical on MD for LJC Summer School

This practical is structured in two main sections. In the first section ```01_MD-Fundamentals``` you will work on a bare-bones MD code, and implement some of the key functions in order to run an MD simulation. In the second part ```02_LAMMPS-electrolyte```, you will look at a more `real-world' example, where you will set up your own simulation and run it on a HPC, and then analyse the resulting trajectory.

## Part 0: Setup
```git clone https://github.com/niamhon/MD-Practical.git ```

## Part 1: MD-Fundamentals

```cd MD-Practical```


In this section we will follow in the footsteps of Aneesur Rahman, who ran published the first molecular dynamics computer simulation on liquid argon in 1964 [[1]](#1). Fittingly for this summer school, we will also be modelling the interactions between the Ar atoms with a Lennard Jones potential. The potential is given by:

$U(r) = 4\epsilon [(\frac{\sigma}{r})^{12} -(\frac{\sigma}{r})^{6} ]$

where $\sigma$ and $\epsilon$ are characteristic lengths and energies for a given system.
We have provided you with a skeleton of the molecular dynamics code.

###Setup:
We want to simulate liquid argon at the same conditions Rahman used.
In this simulation we use reduced Lennard Jones units, so that our potential becomes:

$U^*(r^*) = 4 \left[\left(\frac{1}{r^*}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{1}{r^*}\right)^{6}\right]$

We will initialise the particles on a lattice.
So that your code runs reasonably quickly you should use 125 particles. Your first task is to calculate the box size, temperature and timestep you should use in your simulation in reduced units.

**Qs:** Can you think of reason(s) why we would use reduced units?

**Qs:** The Lennard-Jones parameters for Xenon are $\sigma = 3.96 \AA{}$ and $\epsilon/k_B = 231.1 K $. To what conditions of Xenon does our simulation of Krypton correspond?

### 1:Force Calculation 

### 2:Integration
Implement the simple Euler and Velocity-Verlet algorithms. Check if they are energy conserving.

What happens if you increase the timestep?

### 3: Analysis of trajectory
The radial distribution function gives a measure of structural 
Implement a radial distribution function on the trajectory you have generated.

## Part 2: LAMMPS electrolyte
Now you have got to grips with the basics of running an MD simulation, we will now consider a more complex system, which you may be interested in simulating in a research project. While in the last part, you wrote your own MD code from scratch, in practice MD simulations are run using sophisticated codes -- one of which LAMMPS -- we will be using today.

The system we will look at is an electrolyte solution of NaCl in water in contact with graphene. This is an interesting interfacial system
